Description:
1. The potentiometer can be directly soldered on the board, or it can be led to the panel installation. The kit is equipped with a connecting socket and a connecting wire.
2. The power transformer uses 24V AC output, and the power can be selected as needed. For 30V3A output, the transformer power needs to be greater than 90W.
